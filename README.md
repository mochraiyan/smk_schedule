# SMK Schedule

A web-based application for viewing school schedules for (SMK). This helps students (like me) easily access their daily class schedules and know what comes next dynamicly based on current date & time not static pdf.

May not work properly though, not *yet* tested based on current time, if you want though, tweak out some of the current time & date variable or whatever, I'm lazy af :)

## Tech

- NextJS
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- JSON

## Note
*only for SMK Negeri 2 Students*

If you want to add another schedule for you class, you can view /public/schedule and find any json file with a class name, see the format, and recreate your schedule there in json for your class, and then go to /types/classes add the json entry there, and just like that, should works fine for all, submit pull request, I'll see it and I'll approve if it worked correctly.
